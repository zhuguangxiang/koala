/*
 * binary heap is a complete tree, so use often an array to implement it
 * such as:
 *                   1
 *                 /   \
 *                2     3
 *               / \   / \
 *              4  5  6   7
 *             / \ ... ...
 *            ......
 * Heaps are suited to supporting a sorted list with add and delete,
 * but no lookup.
 * A common application is a (priority) queue, where elements
 * are added at any point, and removed from the front.
 * A heap is a rooted binary tree of elements with an associated comparision
 * function between elements satisfying the property that:
 * element P >= element C(or < )
 * where C(child) is a neighbor of P(parent), and P is nearer the root than C.
 *
 * This implementation uses an array with the elements in slots 1...N, so this
 * translates as:(max heap)
 * x(i) >= x(2i) and x(i) >= x(2i+1) for all i(where this is within the array)
 *
 * index 0 is not used.
